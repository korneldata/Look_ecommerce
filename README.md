# Look_ecommerce
SQL BigQuery and Power BI project.

## Overview
In this project, I used BigQuery SQL to gain valuable business insights from data and visualise them with Power BI.

TheLook is a fictitious eCommerce clothing site developed by the Looker team. The dataset 'theLook eCommerce' contains information about customers, products, orders, logistics, web events and digital marketing campaigns. This dataset is available in BigQuery Public Data.

## Dataset
In general, `theLook eCommerce` dataset contains seven tables, but in my project I made use of six of them.
Here's diagram depicting database tables and relationships between them:

## Data analysis 
In the following sections I analyse different aspects of 'theLook eCommerce' activity: 
- Returns,
- Logistics,
- Sales,
- Customers,
- Traffic sources.
